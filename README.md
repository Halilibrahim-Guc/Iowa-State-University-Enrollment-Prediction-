# Iowa-State-University-Enrollment-Prediction

Using the data from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nickcory/iowa-state-university-enrollment-19982022?resource=download", I tried to develop a time series prediction algorithm using XGBoost. The data is about student enrollment numbers of Iowa State University from 1998 to 2022, the algorithm tries to predict total number of enrollments per semester.
